A Jovo voice app that I built to retrieve a random joke and tell it to the user. This app has an accompanying tutorial that is not yet hosted anywhere. Please feel free to 
pull the code down and modify it as you see fit.

```sh
To start the app simply pull the code and run
$ npm install
$ jovo run

```
